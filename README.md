# Nest.js Project Template

![Nest.js Logo](https://nestjs.com/img/logo_text.svg)

This is a template project for a Nest.js application, featuring a variety of commonly used technologies and best practices.

## Features

- **Helmet**: Helmet helps you secure your Nest.js apps by setting various HTTP headers.
- **TypeORM**: TypeORM is used as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) library to interact with the database.
- **Basic CRUD Operations**: The project includes basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage resources.
- **Validation**: Input validation is implemented using class-validator for both DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) and entities.
- **Swagger**: Swagger is integrated to automatically generate API documentation and provide an interactive API explorer.
- **Docker**: Docker support is included to containerize the application and simplify deployment.
- **Unit Testing**: Unit tests are implemented using Jest to ensure code reliability.
- **E2E Testing**: End-to-end (E2E) tests are included to verify the application's behavior from a user's perspective.
- **Logging**: Logging is implemented using Nest.js built-in logging functionality to track application activity.
- **Linting**: ESLint is used for code linting to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Class-validator**: Class-validator is used for declarative validation of classes and DTOs.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

- **TypeORM**: Update the TypeORM configuration in `ormconfig.json` to connect to your database.
- **Swagger**: Customize the Swagger configuration in `main.ts` to specify API documentation settings.
- **Logging**: Adjust the logging configuration in `app.module.ts` to meet your logging requirements.
- **Linting**: Customize ESLint rules and configurations in `.eslintrc.js` to enforce your code style.

## Usage

### Swagger

Swagger is integrated into the application to automatically generate API documentation. To access the Swagger API explorer:

1. Start the application in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

2. Open your web browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/api-docs](http://localhost:3000/api-docs) to explore the API endpoints.

### Linting

ESLint is used for code linting to maintain code quality and consistency. To lint your code:

```bash
npm run lint
```

ESLint will analyze your code and report any linting errors or warnings based on the rules defined in `.eslintrc.js`. Make sure to address any linting issues before committing your changes.

## Testing

- Run unit tests:

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Run E2E tests:

  ```bash
  npm run test:e2e
  ```
